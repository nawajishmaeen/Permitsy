-- Fix potential RLS (Row Level Security) issues for legal_pages table

-- Enable RLS on the table
ALTER TABLE legal_pages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop any existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous read access to legal pages" ON legal_pages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to manage legal pages" ON legal_pages;

-- Create public read policy (allowing anyone to read the legal pages)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read access to legal pages"

-- Create admin write policy with simplified condition (for testing)
-- This allows any authenticated user to manage the pages
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to manage legal pages"

-- Also create a bypass policy to ensure you can access the data during development
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon access to all operations during development"

-- Check if the table has data
SELECT * FROM legal_pages;
